# Hugo taxonomies example

This is how I'm using taxonomies and pages together in hugo to add custom metadata to taxonomies.

Here's the live view [http://hugo-taxonomies.netlify.com/](http://hugo-taxonomies.netlify.com/)

## How does it work?

- In brands, I created a file for every brand. Those are just regular pages.
- In the brands index, instead of using the default taxonomy list view, I used a section view, since this is a regular section
- In products I used taxonomies

## The benefit

For every taxonomy you have a matching page that contains additional meta data. When you need to show taxonomies metadata, you can get it from their matching pages.
